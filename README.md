# Gastrogo 🍽️

Gastrogo is a food court management system designed to streamline the food ordering process by connecting customers, food vendors, and administrators through a single application.

## 📌 Project Overview

Developed as a Year 2 Semester 1 degree project. **I was responsible to develop the vendor role system**. The app,  Gastrogo allows customers to browse menus from various food vendors, place orders for dine-in, take-away, or delivery, and pay using a built-in credit system. Administrators manage user credit, while vendors are promptly notified to prepare orders and update customers when ready.

The system is built using:
- **Java** for backend logic with text-based file storage.
- **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface.

## 🧑‍💻 Vendor Module (My Role)

As part of the development team, I (Tan Po Yeh) was responsible for implementing the **Vendor** role, which includes:

- Vendor login and registration
- Managing and updating menu items
- Receiving and processing orders in real-time
- Sending notifications to customers upon order completion
- Viewing order history
